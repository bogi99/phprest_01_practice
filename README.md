# a Youtube tutorial code along

This is my code along for a youtube tutorial. i also added the SQL statements to create update and seed the database which was missing from the video material.

Added some extra sanitization steps, specifically for numeric types.

## notes:

* this is a very simplistic restful api implementation.

* the code works, but contains little to no contingency for anything but the happy path, do not use in production or anything public facing.

* the codebase does contain some pretty bad coding habits, but it is simple enough to be understood for the very novice to the restful api and php.
